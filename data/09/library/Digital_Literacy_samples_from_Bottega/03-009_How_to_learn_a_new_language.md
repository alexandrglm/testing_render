# 03-009: How to Learn a New Programming Language

Over the years, I’ve been hired by organizations such as Learn.co and AppDev to write programming curriculum for:

- **Ruby on Rails**
- **Ruby programming**
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **Several JavaScript frameworks**

The only language that I really build applications in is **Ruby**, which means that I’ve been forced to become proficient in a number of languages that I didn’t have much experience with—sometimes in a **very short period of time**.

Over the years, I’ve developed a **system for learning a new language or framework**, and that’s what I’m going to walk through today.

## 📌 Steps to Learning a New Programming Language

### 1️⃣ Watch a Full Tutorial Series 🎥

- **Don’t try to follow along**—simply watch what the instructor does in the demos.
- This helps you get a **high-level view** of the **syntax and flow** of the language.

### 2️⃣ Create a "Hello World" Application 🌍

- Incorporate a few **basics**, such as:
  - Running a **loop**.
  - Creating and **instantiating a class**.
  - Implementing **high-level concepts** you remember from the tutorial.

### 3️⃣ Implement a Sorting Algorithm 🔢

- Pick a **sorting algorithm** and implement it in the language.
- A basic one like **selection sort** or **bubble sort** is fine.
- Sorting algorithms force you to use:
  - **Data structures**
  - **Loops**
  - **Variables**
  - **Functions**
- Combining these elements will give you a **good grasp** of the language.

### 4️⃣ Follow an Advanced Tutorial 📚

- This time, **code along** with the instructor.
- Build the programs **step-by-step** to reinforce learning.

### 5️⃣ Solve Coding Interview Questions 💡

- Work through **interview-style questions** for the language.
- If you can **confidently solve** these, it’s a good sign that you have a **solid understanding** of the language.

## 🎯 The Key Takeaway

I’ve used these five steps for multiple languages, and I can tell you:

- Once you become **proficient** in **one language**, picking up new ones becomes **easier**.
- Most languages share **common processes**, so all you need to do is **learn the syntax differences**.
