# 03-006: Developer Soft Skills

I talk quite a bit about improving as a developer. Most of the time, I focus on how you can learn new technical skills, such as becoming more proficient in a programming language or framework.

However, if you limit your knowledge to technical talent, you will be decreasing your chances for success in the marketplace. In this guide, I’m going to walk through five key developer soft skills that you can utilize to become a well-rounded coder.

This list is by no means comprehensive. Instead, it represents the skills that I’ve personally used and had success with. From being the IT Director of a national energy company in my late 20s to the CTO of a coding bootcamp with locations around the world, I’ve seen these skills help me at every level of my career. And as you’ll notice, they have very little to do with actual technical ability.

> **Note:** These skills should complement your engineering talent, not overshadow skills such as practicing clean coding habits or focusing on improving as a developer.

## 📝 Writing

First on the list is the ability to **write**. In the book *ReWork*, the authors, who are also the founders of Basecamp and the Ruby on Rails framework, wrote that one of the skills they look for in job candidates is their ability to write—even for developers and system administrators.

A developer must be skilled as a coder. However, the book explains that if a developer can write, it is a sign that they are a **good communicator**. Writing skill doesn’t mean that each memo has to sound like a riveting novel. Instead, it means that:

- You can **organize your thoughts** properly.
- You can **communicate** what you want to say so that others can understand.

## 🗣️ Conversation

Next on the list is the ability to **converse well with others**.

If you’re like me, this is by far the most challenging skill. If I had my way, I’d stay behind my desk building applications all day and never interact with another human. However, conversational skills are an **absolute requirement** when it comes to advancing in your career.

Whether you are a **freelance developer** looking for new clients or a **software engineer** looking to get promoted, you’ll discover that the top prerequisite to your success is not technical skill, it’s **likability**. If someone likes you, they are going to want to give you a chance to succeed.

### 🔹 Conversation Tips

Here are some tips to improve at this skill:

- **Have entertaining stories** about yourself. People love stories, especially funny ones. A well-timed story can help build strong connections.
- **Make the focus on the other person.** People love talking about themselves, so by simply asking insightful questions, you will be considered a great conversationalist.
- **DO NOT COMPLAIN.** Nobody enjoys talking with someone who constantly complains. Be upbeat and positive, and you will stand out.

## 📊 Management

The next soft skill is **management**.

Even if you are an entry-level developer, **management doesn’t have to mean managing people or projects**. Instead, it refers to how you **approach each task** you’re given.

For example, if you are handed a new feature to build, do you **jump right in and start coding**, or do you **take a structured approach**?

Clients and managers will feel more confident giving you responsibility if they see that you take a **systematic approach** to your tasks.

📌 **Consider reading project management books or taking an online course on the topic.**

## 🎨 Design

Scott Adams (the creator of *Dilbert*) wrote in *How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big* that knowing the **basic fundamentals of design** should be required knowledge for all engineers.

Many developers say, *“design really isn’t my thing.”* But understanding the **basics of good design** takes very little effort, and it can make a huge difference in your career.

### 📌 Why Design Matters

- A poorly designed application will overshadow even the **most powerful functionality**.
- Many developers **lose opportunities** because they ignore design principles.
- Learning the **fundamentals of UI/UX** can give you an edge in the industry.

## 🎤 Public Speaking

Finally, we have **public speaking**. This may seem like a useless skill for a software developer, but let’s consider two scenarios:

### Scenario 1

A brilliant developer with poor public speaking skills presents a well-built project in a **monotone voice** and gives a dull demo.

### Scenario 2

Another talented developer has worked on their **public speaking skills**. They give a **well-organized demo**, speak with **clarity and confidence**, and make the project engaging with anecdotes and analogies.

💡 **Which project would seem more appealing?** The second developer will win every time.

### 🏆 Becoming a Better Public Speaker

1. **Join a Toastmasters group.** Practicing in front of a group weekly helps tremendously.
2. **Listen to one TED Talk each day.** TED Talks are given by some of the best speakers in the world. They help build a mental model of what makes a great speech.

## 🎯 The Importance of Soft Skills

Now that you know the list, how important are developer soft skills?

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen **an inferior developer get promoted** simply based on their ability to **speak well in meetings** or **converse with co-workers**.

The key to these soft skills is that they help people **feel comfortable** around you and **confident** that you can get the job done. **Likability and confidence** are two key factors you’ll need to gain an edge in the marketplace.
