# 3.18 Practical Ways to Use the Pomodoro Technique as a Developer

As we continue to work through ways to **hack the developer’s mind**, the focus of this guide is going to be on **increasing productivity**. Specifically, we’re going to analyze practical ways to use the **Pomodoro Technique**.

I’m constantly researching new ways to improve my personal productivity. And through my journey as a developer, a popular approach that I’ve discovered is the **Pomodoro technique**. This is a process that I’ve utilized, and I credit it with allowing me to focus on a **large number of tasks** each day.

## Pomodoro Technique Definition

Don’t let the weird name scare you away. The **Pomodoro technique** is a **dead simple productivity system** that focuses on splitting tasks into **timed intervals** throughout the day.

## Practical Ways to Use the Pomodoro Technique

### Pomodoro Technique Process

One of the greatest strengths of the Pomodoro technique is how **easy it is to implement**. The process that I follow is:

1. **Each morning**, I pick out the tasks that I want to accomplish that day.
2. I then decide **how long each task will take**. The Pomodoro technique works on a **point system**. Each time you work through a **25-minute task**, you earn a point.
3. Typically, I try to earn **10 Pomodoro points** each day. This means that if I have **3 tasks** that I know will take an hour each, I will earn **6 points** for those tasks. And it means that I have **4 additional 25-minute slots** available for the rest of the day.

### Taking a Break

Did you notice how I kept saying **25-minute time slots**? There is a reason for the odd number. The Pomodoro technique places a **high priority on taking scheduled breaks**. After completing each **25-minute task**, you take a **5-minute break**. During this free time, you can do **anything you want**. 

You can get on social media, take a walk around the block, or anything that you want to do. Just make sure that your break does not exceed **5 minutes**.

Also, after you’ve completed **4 tasks**, it’s recommended that you take a **15-minute break**. However, you can tailor your breaks and intervals to what works best with your schedule.

By planning breaks throughout the day, you will **decrease your chances of burnout**. And I’ve noticed that I no longer feel bad about doing things such as checking my Instagram account or Hacker News throughout the day because I can fit my **guilty pleasures** into my scheduled free time.

This is one of the aspects that I truly love about the Pomodoro technique. Many of the other productivity systems I’ve tried in the past tend to lead individuals towards **burning out**. However, the Pomodoro approach allows you to have a sense of **balance**.

### Lifestyle vs Fads

Have you ever tried **dieting** before? When I was younger, I struggled with my weight, and to help fix it, I tried a number of **intense diets**. This included nutrition strategies such as dramatically decreasing calories or killing off carbs. However, I noticed that I’d stay true to the diet for a few weeks or even a few months. Eventually, though, I would fall back into **poor eating habits**. Once I recognized this trend, I moved to having a **balanced approach** to eating. I stopped trying nutritional fads and transitioned my focus into eating in a way I felt I could eat **the rest of my life**.

I made this change in my nutritional approach a few years ago, and it’s completely stopped my roller coaster dieting and weight loss and weight gain.

### A Lifestyle of Productivity

In the same way, when I was younger, I fell into the same pattern with working on tasks. I’d get excited about working on a project or learning a new programming language. And I would spend **countless hours** working on what I wanted to accomplish. However, this approach inevitably led to **burning out** and large stretches of time where I didn’t want to work at all.

I look at the Pomodoro technique in the same way that I look at having a **balanced diet**. By limiting the number of tasks that I work on each day and by implementing **planned breaks** between each task, I no longer burn myself out. Additionally, after I have finished my work for the day and have earned my **10 Pomodoro points**, I feel a sense of **accomplishment** that I never felt before. And after work, I don’t feel guilty spending time with my family and friends because I know that I completed every task that I set out to work on that day.

### Practical Implementation

So, how can you implement the program? There are a few ways.

To start off, you can simply use the **timer on your phone** and then count up each of the tasks/points that you achieved each day. That’s how I started off working with the Pomodoro technique.

Additionally, there are a number of **smartphone apps** that have Pomodoro timers and even allow for creating a **task list** that you can use as a pick list for your tasks each day. I like these types of apps because they also give you **historical analytics**, so you can see how many tasks you’ve completed each day. The **Pomodoro Focus app** is my personal favorite (and it’s free).
