# 3.19 Development Study Tips: Reverse Note Taking

In this guide, we’re going to go back in time and walk through when I developed the system of **reverse note-taking**. A quick Google search will show that I have coined the term, but I did not invent the process.

Back when I started **computer science grad school** at **Texas Tech**, I was struggling with one of my classes. It had been about a decade since I had been in a classroom environment, and I was having a difficult time paying attention to the **1.5-hour lectures**.

## The Problem with Traditional Note Taking

During this time, I spent quite a bit of time meeting with **Dr. Richard Watson**. During one of our meetings, I brought up the issues I was having. His first question was based on how I was taking notes for the course.

I showed him my notes, and he instantly told me that I was taking notes **completely wrong**. He pointed out multiple places in my notes where I had missed **key concepts** that were unifying elements. And without noting these items, I wouldn’t understand the topics at all.

In reviewing the notes, I realized he was **completely right**. I spent my time writing down facts and what I thought were key terms. However, I regularly failed to articulate how everything worked together.

For example, for my notes on **tree data structures**, I outlined each of the key elements of **binary search trees** and **B-Trees**. But I failed to describe the **innate differences** of the three components from a **behavior perspective**. This would be similar to taking notes in a history class and writing down the names, dates, and locations for **Napoleon’s loss at the Battle of Waterloo** without describing the **critical differences** between his old armies and the one he lost with.

## Reverse Note Taking

Finding out that I was taking notes wrong was great. But it wouldn’t have been too useful without learning an **alternative approach**. So, Dr. Watson asked me to try a different type of note-taking technique.

He said to **put my pen and paper away during class**. Instead of taking notes during class, he recommended that I simply **listen to the lecture**. He instructed that as soon as the lecture was over, I should find a quiet place and **THEN write down all of the topics** that I remembered from the discussion.

Initially, I was **skeptical** of this approach, mainly because I was afraid that the important concepts would go in one ear and out the other. He added that I should **tape-record the lecture** so that I could use the recording as a **safety net** for the topics that I failed to remember.

Despite my negative perspective on the approach, I decided to give it a try. (Obviously, my natural note-taking approach wasn’t effective, so I didn’t have much to lose).

I followed Dr. Watson’s advice to the letter. And I was **pleasantly surprised** to discover that I remembered **much more information** using this reverse note-taking approach compared with simply trying to write down concepts during the lecture.

## Benefits of Reverse Note Taking

I started following this **reverse note-taking process** years ago, and I still use it today. Through this time, I’ve noticed a number of **key benefits** to this approach.

---

### Narrowed Focus

First and foremost, having the knowledge that I will have to **recite back the key components** of the lecture forces me to have an **increased level of focus**. This is the opposite of how I used to take notes. My old way of taking notes would many times **distract me** from the concepts being discussed. I would hear a concept that I felt was important, and I would take my focus away from the speaker and focus on writing down the topic.

Many times, this would inadvertently **steal my focus** away from another important concept or a description of how the topic I was writing down worked at a high level.

Additionally, as a **naturally competitive person**, I would make a game of how much I could remember from each lecture. If I was able to remember enough to write down **two pages of notes** on Monday, I would try to write down **two and a half pages** on Tuesday. By making a game of the practice, it forced me to **narrow my focus** even more on the content.

### Story-Based Mindset

Another benefit to reverse note-taking is that it forced me to think of the lecture as a **unified story** instead of a series of facts. Let’s go back to our illustration of **Napoleon’s battle at Waterloo**. If you listen to a lecture about the battle and take notes during the class, you’d probably do things like write down:

- **General names**
- **Cities where battles took place**
- **Dates**
- **Etc.**

However, if you simply **listen intently** to the lecture and recite it back afterward, you won’t repeat dates and locations. Instead, you will naturally remember the battle in **story form**. You’ll discuss the struggles that the **Duke of Wellington** had to overcome in order to lead the charge against the French army. And because it’s a story, your **retention of the topics** will be considerably higher compared with attempting to memorize facts and figures.

If I were to ask you to remember back to a **high school history class** and to a **movie you saw in high school**, would you have a better chance of remembering the plot of the movie or the history lecture?

So, getting back to my **computer science grad school experience**, by leveraging the reverse note-taking strategy, I forced myself to think of the topics discussed during the lecture as a **story** as opposed to a bunch of theories and math equations.

### Forced Repetition

Lastly, the reverse note-taking approach made it easier to **review the lecture material** compared with my old style of note-taking. Previously, I rarely would listen to a lecture recording. Even if I had the intention to listen to the recording, other priorities always seemed to **override the task**. I mainly attribute this failure to the fact that I, for some reason, **trusted my notes**.

However, when I started reverse note-taking, I would always listen to the lecture a **second time** to fill in any items that I missed during my post-note writing session. I discovered this single benefit to be **critical to my success** since it became an **automatic habit** to reinforce my knowledge. In contrast to my old approach where I trusted my untrustworthy notes, with reverse note-taking, I didn’t trust my memory, so I knew I had to **reinforce my memory**. And the consequence was that I always would listen to a lecture **twice**, with the final result being a **dramatic increase in retention**.

## Summary

This approach is **not for everyone**. I know students who excel with a more **traditional note-taking strategy**. However, if you find yourself in a situation like me, I highly recommend you give **reverse note-taking a chance**. You may be surprised how effective it can be.
