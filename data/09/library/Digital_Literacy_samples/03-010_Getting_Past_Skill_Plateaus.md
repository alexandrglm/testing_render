# 03-010: Getting Past Skill Plateaus

## 🏔️ The Skill Plateau Pattern

A common pattern I see with students learning how to code is:

```
• Quickly learning a massive amount of information.
• Followed by running into a seemingly insurmountable wall. In this phase the student typically feels like they’ve reached the zenith of what they’re going to be able to accomplish in regard to development.
```

This second phase is called a **plateau**. In this guide, we’re going to walk through **strategies for getting past skill plateaus**.

I’ve spoken before about **learning curves**. It’s important to understand that everyone follows a **similar pattern** when it comes to learning a new skill. This means that there will be times when you feel like you’re absorbing a **wealth of new information every day**. But it also means that there will be times when it **feels like your mind is limiting you from learning anything new**.

## 📖 What is a Learning Plateau?

When it comes to **hitting a learning plateau**, it’s important to look at the **potential root causes**. It has been my experience that **no two plateaus are the same**. Until you’ve diagnosed **why** you’re not learning, you won’t be able to **move forward to your next skill level**.

### 🚫 False Ceiling

Before I continue, I want to reiterate something:

> **You will never reach a point where your level of skill is maxed out.**

Maybe if you’re a professional athlete and getting older, your body is naturally going to decrease in performance. But when it comes to **concepts like development**, as long as you continue to **dedicate yourself** and **listen to experts**, your skill will **never** reach a peak.

## 🚀 Getting Past Skill Plateaus

Through the years, I have witnessed a few key reasons why individuals (including myself) run into **skill plateaus**.

### 📚 1️⃣ Proper Information & Resources

- When a student **lacks access** to the right information, learning becomes **more difficult**.
- Imagine a talented **high school developer** who relies on a teacher with **limited skills**.
- **Solution:** The student should seek **additional resources**, such as **online courses**, books, and mentors to gain **new concepts**.

### ✅ 2️⃣ Mastering Best Practices

- Learning **best practices** can sometimes feel like hitting a plateau.
- **Example:** When I first learned **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, it felt counterintuitive.
- Writing tests took **2-3 times longer** than coding directly.
- **Frustration:** It felt like I **wasn’t learning anything new**, since my new knowledge didn’t immediately impact visible results.
- **Solution:** Be **patient** and **embrace this phase**. Once you master best practices, your ability to **develop efficiently** will increase **dramatically**.

### 🔄 3️⃣ Challenging Yourself with New Tasks

- The main reason students **hit a skill plateau** is that they **stop challenging themselves**.
- **Early learning growth** happens because **everything is new**.
- Over time, developers tend to **repeat the same tasks**, avoiding new challenges.
- **Solution:**
  - Look at **popular websites** (e.g., Twitter, Airbnb, Pinterest).
  - **Compile a list** of advanced features you’ve never built.
  - Plan out what **concepts** you need to learn to **implement them**.

### 😡 4️⃣ Frustration = Skill Growth

One of my favorite illustrations of **getting past skill plateaus** was made by calligrapher **Jamin Brown**.

Notice in this illustration how the learning process is filled with plateaus?   

This is a natural component when it comes to improving at any skill.  

 But also notice that the key to overcoming a plateau is called the Frustration Zone.

I think that’s a **great name** for it. **Learning complex topics is not easy**. You’ve probably heard this phrase countless times:

> **“If it were easy, everyone would do it.”**

Becoming a developer can be **one of the most rewarding experiences**. Part of what makes learning to code **so fulfilling** is the number of **challenges you’ll need to overcome** to succeed.

## 🎯 Summary

I hope this guide has provided **practical strategies** for getting past **skill plateaus**.

- **Learning plateaus are normal** and happen to all developers.
- **Identify the cause** of your plateau before making adjustments.
- **Embrace frustration** as a key to overcoming your current limitations.
- **Push forward** and continue challenging yourself with **new, difficult tasks**.
