# 03-008: What Does it Take to Become a Great Developer?

Whether you’ve been programming for years or if you’re just now learning how to code, it’s natural to ask yourself: **what does it take to become a great developer?**

There is no **right or wrong** answer to this question. If you ask 100 experienced software engineers, you’ll get **100 different responses**. Development is truly **an art form**, much like asking what makes a great artist.

Even though becoming a great developer may seem like a daunting task, there is a **practical process** you can follow to reach your development goals.

## 🔑 Key Traits of Great Developers

After researching developers, reading blogs, and listening to podcasts, I found that great developers share six key traits. Below is an **overview** of these characteristics, along with strategies for incorporating them into your routine.

### 1️⃣ Working Through Difficult Features

The only way to improve as a developer is to **work through challenging concepts**. It’s easy to fall into a routine of repeating the same tasks, but this **stagnates growth**.

💡 **Key Takeaways:**

- Growth happens **outside your comfort zone**.
- Work on **challenging features** like:
  - Infinite scrolling
  - Asynchronous notifications
  - Multi-page authentication
- **Research** features on sites like Twitter, Airbnb, and Pinterest.

📖 *In the book* Peak, *researchers found that elite performers in all fields improve only when they push beyond their comfort zones.*

### 2️⃣ Community Contribution

The **open-source community** has grown exponentially, with languages like Python and Ruby being developed by **individuals, not corporations**.

💡 **Ways to Contribute:**

- **New developers** → Help beginners by answering questions.
- **Experienced developers** → Build open-source tools or contribute to language development.
- **Benefits** → Writing code that others will **review and use** forces you to **improve your skills**.

### 3️⃣ Artistry in Code

Development is not just about logic—it’s about **crafting elegant, simple, and efficient solutions**.

💡 **Key Quotes:**

- **Sandi Metz:** “Novice programmers don’t yet have the skills to write simple code.”
- **Einstein:** “If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself.”

💡 **Strategy:** The more you improve, the simpler your work should be.

### 4️⃣ Craftsmanship

Taking pride in your work separates **great developers** from those who just “get the job done.”

💡 **Balancing Quality vs. Perfection:**

- Some developers treat coding as **an assembly line task**.
- Others treat their work as **an art form**.
- **The balance:** Code should be **well-designed**, but not **over-engineered**.

📖 *Steve Jobs once said:*  

> “When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it.”

### 5️⃣ Adapting to Change

One **constant** in software development is **change**. Great developers **adapt** to evolving requirements and maintain **flexibility** in their approach.

💡 **Common Mistakes:**

1. **Rigid code design** → Leads to major rewrites when features change.
2. **Planning for the wrong future** → Trying to predict future requirements often leads to unnecessary complexity.

💡 **Solution:**

- Write **modular code** with **low coupling**.
- Design features with **flexible interfaces** that allow for changes without breaking other parts of the system.

---

### 6️⃣ Tireless Learning

Great developers **never stop learning**. No matter your experience level, there will always be **new frameworks, languages, and processes** to explore.

💡 **How to Stay Sharp:**

- **Learn one new language/framework per year** → Build a **real-world project** with it.
- **Read books daily** → Even **short daily reading** keeps your skills fresh.
- **Follow advanced tutorials** → Blogs and guides from experienced developers can expose you to new concepts.
- **Subscribe to newsletters** → Stay updated on changes in **your favorite tech stacks** (e.g., Ruby, JavaScript, Python).
